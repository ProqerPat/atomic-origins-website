                    <p>The beginning of the atomic age didn't begin with an explosion, but with a series of scientific
                        breakthroughs that came to define modern physics. As researchers explored the properties of the
                        atom in the early 20th century, they uncovered forces far stronger and complex than anything
                        previously imagined. What started as theoretical physics, soon became the foundation for a
                        discovery that would forever alter global science, warfare, and politics.</p>

                    <p>As these discoveries unfolded, J. Robert Oppenheimer emerged as one of the lead scientists in the
                        feild. As a theoretical physicist with a deep understanding of quantum mechanics,
                        Oppenheimer helped connect atomic theory to practical scientific research. Long before the world
                        knew his name would be tied to such an unprecedented weapon, his ability to interpret complex
                        ideas and push experimental boundaries put him at the center of America's expanding interest in
                        nuclear physics.</p>
